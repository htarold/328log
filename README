What
====
328log turns a cheap Arduino Pro Mini stamp board into a standalone low
rate data logger, sampling from the ADC and writing to the device's
own flash.  No external SD card is used.  The 30kB of available
flash is enough for about 23,000 data points.  At a typical
sample interval of 4 seconds, the device can store over a day's
worth of data.

Why
===
Often I will have some Arduino Pro Mini boards on hand, because they
can be had for as little as $3 a piece.  328log makes it trivial
to collect data with few extra components, and the board can be
reused for as a general purpose MCU.

How
===
328log is NOT an Arduino "sketch"; it replaces the Arduino
bootloader that ships with the board.  To do this, you need
an in-circuit serial programmer (ISP), such as USBASP, or
ArduinoISP.  If you have an Arduino IDE installed, you will
already have all the software tools you need to programme the
board with 328log.

To flash the programme image:
path/to/avrdude -v -F -p m328p -c usbasp -C path/to/avrdude.conf \
  -U flash:w:328log.hex -U eeprom:w:328log.eeprom.hex
where path/to/avrdude and path/to/avrdude.conf are somewhere in the
Arduino directory under hardware/tools/.  This assumes you are
using USBASP as the programmer.

Alternatively you can type "make 328log.program" if you have
development tools installed.

You will not need to change the fuse bits; they are the same as
for the Arduino.

Quick start
===========
After flashing the image (see above), connect to the device with a
serial cable (TTL level in the case of the Pro Mini), 19200 8N1.

Connect some voltage source to pins A0-A3 if desired.  You can
just tie some to ground, and others to Vcc.  Or leave them
floating to record some random values.

Power on the device if not already on.

Hit the reset button on the device if you don't see a usage message.

Type "VVVV1# Logging 4 channels every 1 second" and hit enter.

Wait 4 seconds until you see "Logging started".

Wait another 1.5 minutes until you see "Flushed".

Reset or power cycle the device.

Choose D (upper case) for download.  View your data!

Choose e (lower case), then confirm with y to erase the data.

Wait 4 seconds for device to start logging again, or press a key
to re-enter a new options string, or power off.

To use operationally, after erasing any data and setting the options
string, power off the device before the next "Flushed" message.
When it is next powered on, it will begin logging (after giving
you a 4-second opportunity to change the options).  The terminal
does not need to be attached.

Logging stops when the device is powered off or reset.

If you find this useful, drop me a note.

Caveats
=======
Try not to mix voltage references; either use all 'V' (Vcc as
ref) or 'v' (internal 1.1V ref).  When the reference is changed,
the old voltage has to bleed off the cap at the AREF pin, and
how long this takes depends on the cap size.
